Values declared in a block are only visible inside that block.
values outside of a block are visible inside of a block,
unless they are shadows by a value of the same name inside the block.



The following is interpreted by the scala compiler as two separate expressions:
    someLongExpression
        + someOtherExpression

The solution:

    (someLongExpression
        + someOtherExpression)

Or
    someLongExpression +
        someOtherExpression


gcd() calls itself as it's last action, therefore it is tail recursive.
factorial() is not tail recursive as after the call to factorial(n-1), there was still work to be done.
